AirBnB clone - The console

## Project description
The AirBnB Clone - The Console project is a command-line-based application that emulates certain functionalities of the AirBnB website.
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

## Description of the command interpreter:
The command interpreter, often referred to as "The Console," is the core component of this project. It enables users to perform various operations, manage resources, and execute specific tasks related to the AirBnB clone.
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter  serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python

Some of the commands available are:
- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:
-   Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating attributes of an object
-   Destroying an object

## How to start it
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.

## Installing

You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.

After cloning the repository you will have a folder called AirBnB_clone. In here there will be several files that allow the program to work.

> /console.py : The main executable of the project, the command interpreter.
>
> models/engine/file_storage.py: Class that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances
> 
> models/__ init __.py:  A unique `FileStorage` instance for the application
> 
> models/base_model.py: Class that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes.
> 
> models/user.py: User class that inherits from BaseModel
> 
>models/state.py: State class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/city.py: City class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/amenity.py: Amenity class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/place.py: Place class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/review.py: Review class that inherits from BaseModel
